Time-Series


Regression and time series analysis: 
no concept of time in regression
TSR(Time series analysis): time is crucial
			   Time stamp is taken

opposite of time series analysis is FDA(frequency domain analysis)
FDA: How often you get good score or how often you get bad scaore
FDA or spectral analysis

Time series: an ordered sequence of values 
 Univariate or multi variate /   discrete or continuous /linear or    non-linear/
    time domain vs frequency domain

Application of time series:
   Economic forecasting
   sales forecasting
   budgetary analysis
   stock market
   yield projections
   process and quality control
   inventory studies
   workload projections
   Utility studies
   census analysis


Time series:
	4 components:
		trend
		sesional
		Random
		Cylical

Random walk or stochastic process: a model to predict a rando behaviour.
example: Stock price

predict in regression and classification 
Forecast in time series

For forecasting based on the analised and discribed data:

Additive model: y(t)= T(t)+S(t)+C(t)+I(t)
	* all componenets are different
Multiplicative model:


Model for tracking the trend componenet or smoothing:
	
RMSE(root mean square): means we are doing regression


Exponential weights:
	Weighted moving average:

Noise component : White noise -> Irrespctive of frequency

Gaussian White noise:
